In the problem analysis part, I think we could add this... 
Description : when companies  need an able
employee and there's none in the list of applicants or there's really
no one applying.
Causes : There's no central container/repository where all possible employees
details are kept exist.
Symptoms : Some companies will need to conduct immediate hiring
Impact : Having no one to fill a position in a company can hamper the whole
business process and at the same time, conducting immediate hiring may 
not be able to filter properly the lists of applicants.
